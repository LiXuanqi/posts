## Introduction

Trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a data structure used for efficient retrieval of strings or words, particularly when there is a need for prefix-based operations. e.g. Autocomplete

It has 3 main operations:

- insert(word): add a new word to trie.
- find(word): determine if a given word exists in the trie.
- start_with(): find all words in the trie that have a given prefix

## TrieNode

Bellow is a trie which stores words: app, apple, apply and boy

In a trie, each node represents a character or a partial string. The root node represents an empty string, and each additional node represents a character or a combination of characters that form a prefix or complete word. **The edges between nodes represent the characters that lead from one node to another.**

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}  # dictionary to store child nodes
        self.is_word_end = False  # flag to indicate the end of a word

class Trie:
    def __int__(self):
        self.root = TrideNode() # root represents empty string
```

## Insert

```python
def insert(self, word):
    curr = self.root
    for c in word:
        if c not in curr.children:
            node.children[c] = TrieNode() # insert a new node
        curr = node.children[c]
    node.is_word_end = True
```

Starts from the root and iterate all characters in the given words. Create new node as necessary and mark the last node as the end of word.

## Find

```python
def find(self, word):
    curr = self.root
    for c in word:
        if c not in curr.children:
            return False # edge doesn't exist
        curr = node.children[c]
    return node.is_word_end
```

`find(word){:python}` is very similar to `insert(word)`. The differences are:

- return `False` if node doesn't exist
- check whether last node is a word or partial string. e.g. If trie only has word "apple" and we call `find(app)`, the path exists, but it's not a word.
